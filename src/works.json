While the data is not real-time, it is relatively recent, typically ranging from a few months ago. We retrieve the data through the OpenWeather API, which requires longitude and latitude parameters to specify the geographic location. To facilitate this, we compiled a list of longitude and latitude coordinates for all the provinces in Indonesia.",
