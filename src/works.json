While the data is not real-time, it is relatively recent, typically ranging from a few months ago. We retrieve the data through the OpenWeather API, which requires longitude and latitude parameters to specify the geographic location. To facilitate this, we compiled a list of longitude and latitude coordinates for all the provinces in Indonesia. In this project I contributed in the navbar, footer, calculator, and other minor styling.",

The system serves both customers and administrators, allowing users to conveniently place orders and browse the available ramen options. Administrators have access to vital features such as generating reports, tracking all RAAMEN transactions, and managing ramen-related actions.
